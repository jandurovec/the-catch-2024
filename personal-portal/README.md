# Personal portal (1 point)

Hi, CSIRT trainee,

check if there is a leak of non-public data on the personal portal.

* The portal is accesible at http://perso.cypherfix.tcc.

See you in the next incident!

## Hints

* Don't waste time trying to log in.
* Base64 is most popular encoding.

## Solution

When we open the portal and follow the `Help` link we can see a directory
listing on the server.

![Directory listing](directory-listing.png)

Trying to access the documents directly by clicking the links returns
`404 Not Found`, however, we can notice that the URL of the help page is
`http://perso.cypherfix.tcc/files?file=help.html`. Since `help.html` is one of
the files we can see in the listing, we can deduce that the script displays a
file from this directory based on provided argument.

By replacing the parameter value we can retrieve the other files in the
directory. `meeting2024-09-05.md` contains a familiar signature string which
yields a flag when decoded.
